This is the repository for the CDN release of Highlight.js that can be found on
[cdnjs][1], [jsDelivr][2], and [unpkg][3]. If you were looking for the main
repository, it is [located here][4]. If you simply need a pre-built copy of
our CDN assets, this is the repository you are looking for. All the files are 
in the `build` directory and you can copy over that directory to where ever 
you need it.

### Fetching via NPM

This repository is also published to NPM as [@highlightjs/cdn-assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@highlightjs/cdn-assets).
